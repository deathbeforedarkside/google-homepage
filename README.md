This is a project that I will be working on to study coding/programming.
 I am utilizing The Odin Projects curriculum to accomplish this.
 At the time of writing this, I can only assume that this project will involve creating a website similar to that of www.google.com.
 If you are reading this, know that I am but a novice, and starting to age.
 It is harder to store new knowledge as you get older, especially if you lived the life I did when I was younger.
 I fear for the future of the planet.
 It seems humanity will only ever want to compete with itself, rather than achieve enlightenment.
